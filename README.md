# CGM Data Project  

This project automates the processing and visualization of continuous glucose monitor (CGM) data. It uses Python and SQLite to create and maintain a database of readings, ensuring clean, consistent data for analysis.  

The program:  
- Detects the latest CSV file of glucose readings without manual renaming or file moves  
- Validates data integrity by removing duplicates and checking for missing dates  
- Restricts stored readings to the most recent 90 days, optimizing storage and relevance  
- Exports the cleaned dataset for use in Tableau visualizations  

## Repository Contents  
- **Create Database SQL Magic.ipynb**  
  Jupyter Notebook for creating an SQLite database, adding a table, and inserting records.  

- **Dexcom Clarity Readings SQLite SQL Magic v2.ipynb**  
  Python code that locates the newest data file in the downloads folder, processes it, and updates the SQLite database. Manual file handling is no longer required.  

- **Guide to Continuous Glucose Monitor Visualizations.pdf**  
  A reference guide describing the visualization styles, analytical approaches, and commonly used CGM measures.
